# Market Narrative Engine

**Explain the market. Don’t predict it.**

Market Narrative Engine is a market intelligence system that translates price action into structured, plausible narratives.  
Instead of forecasting prices or flooding users with raw data, it explains *why* assets moved by contextualizing them within sector behavior, market regimes, and known catalysts.

> Markets move on stories.  
> This engine surfaces the dominant ones.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

Most market tools do one of two things:

- 📈 Predict prices  
- 📊 Display raw data  

This project does something different:

> **It explains market behavior using narrative attribution rather than prediction.**

Key principles:

- Markets move for **multiple overlapping reasons**
- Traders act on **interpretations**, not equations
- There is no single “truth” — only **dominant explanations**
- The goal is **clarity**, not certainty

This positions the engine as a **decision-support and interpretation tool**, not a trading signal.

## 🧩 What the Engine Produces

### 1. Asset-Level Narratives (Micro)

For any stock or ETF, the engine generates a concise explanation of recent price action.

**Example — Alibaba (BABA):**

> **BABA +4.2%**
> Alibaba outperformed the broader market as investors focused on the growth potential of its AI infrastructure and NVIDIA H200 integration despite rising capital expenditures. The positive price action suggests a rotation into oversold emerging market leaders that demonstrate innovation discipline. Watch for upcoming earnings to confirm if AI revenue growth can offset cash flow concerns and sustain this relative strength. 
> Recent strength follows a period of prolonged underperformance and coincides with renewed optimism around China tech and AI infrastructure exposure.  
> Outperformance versus SPY suggests relative positioning recovery rather than broad market beta.

Each narrative answers:

- What moved?
- Why did it likely move?
- What *kind* of move is this?

---

### 2. Relative Performance & Context

Assets are evaluated **relative to benchmarks** (e.g. SPY), not in isolation.

Displayed context includes:

- Rolling return windows (1D / 5D / 30D)
- Outperformance vs benchmark
- Confidence score in explanation
- Visual price history vs index
- Recent range and inflection points

This frames moves as *contextual*, not absolute.

---

### 3. Market & News Catalysts

The engine surfaces relevant market narratives and commentary and ties them to observed price behavior — without simply summarizing headlines.

**Example Context:**

- Emerging markets ETF commentary (IEMG)
- China tech sentiment inflection
- AI-related GPU shipment developments
- Relative risk-on behavior vs US equities

This helps distinguish:

- Event-driven moves  
- Regional or sector sympathy  
- Mean reversion vs momentum continuation  
- Positioning or flow-driven recoveries  

---

### 4. Narrative Confidence

Each explanation includes a **confidence score** — not confidence in returns, but confidence in the *explanation itself*.

High confidence reflects:
- Strong relative performance signals
- Peer or regional confirmation
- Coherent narrative alignment between price and context

---

## 🧪 Narrative Labels (Structured, Not Vibes)

Each move is implicitly categorized using analytical labels such as:

- Sector-driven
- Region-driven (e.g. Emerging Markets / China)
- Event-aware
- Momentum continuation
- Mean reversion
- Positioning recovery
- Low-conviction / noise

This structure keeps the system analytical rather than opinionated.

---

## 📈 Narrative Drift Over Time

A core idea behind the engine is that **narratives evolve** even when prices don’t immediately follow.

For example:

- Early phase: prolonged underperformance
- Mid phase: sentiment stabilization
- Later phase: relative outperformance and narrative repair

Tracking how explanations change over time helps users understand *how stories shift before trends fully emerge*.

## 🚫 What This Is Not

- ❌ A trading bot  
- ❌ A signal service  
- ❌ A price prediction engine  
- ❌ A news summarizer  

It is intentionally **non-prescriptive**.

---

## 👥 Intended Audience

- Discretionary traders
- Market analysts
- Portfolio managers
- Finance students learning how to interpret price action

Anyone who wants to think **better**, not faster.
